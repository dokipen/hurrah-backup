Backup tar.gz files to s3 from an apache index page. Relies on environmental
variables:

 - HURRAH_BUCKET : s3 bucket
 - HURRAH_ACCESS_KEY_ID : Amazon access key
 - HURRAH_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY : Amazon secret key
 - HURRAH_TITLE : Title of generated s3 index file for display only.
 - HURRAH_INDEX : URL of the apache index

It is meant to be run from cron however often you see fit, but before the files
are deleted from the server.

Files listed are expected to end with tar.gz and have an associated md5sum with
the same name, that ends in md5. Ex.

awesomebackup.tar.gz
awesomebackup.md5

Files will be renamed by timestamp as reported by apache before uploading to s3.
