Backup tar.gz files to s3 from an apache index page. Relies on environmental
variables:

 - HURRAH_BUCKET
 - HURRAH_ACCESS_KEY_ID
 - HURRAH_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
 - HURRAH_TITLE
 - HURRAH_INDEX

It is meant to be run from cron however often you see fit, but before the files
are deleted from the server.

TODO: Verify against checksums if they exist.
